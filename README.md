# Zip code and income cross-reference

This is just something I threw together quickly because a client needed to exclude low-income zips from a PPC campaign.

Data is from the 2000 census.

Note that the ZCTA used by the census does NOT track perfectly with zip code boundaries! It's close enough for these purposes, though.

Data accuracy is not guaranteed, and there is absolutely no warranty on this software.

Once I've got all the zips matched up to states, I'll post the data, as well.
